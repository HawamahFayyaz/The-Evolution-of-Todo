schema:
  event_id: string (uuid, required)
  event_type: string (required)
  event_version: string (required)

  source: string (service name, required)
  data:
    # Event-specific fields
    field_name: type (description)
  metadata:

  event_type: "task.created"
  event_version: "1.0"

  source: "todo-backend"
  data:
    task_id: 123
    user_id: "user_abc"
    title: "Example task"
  metadata:
    correlation_id: "req_xyz"

consumers:
  - service-name (what it does with this event)

partition_key: "user_id"  # For ordering events per user

notes:
  - "Events are immutable - never modify published events"
  - "Use past tense (created, not create)"
  - "Include enough data for consumers to act without querying"
