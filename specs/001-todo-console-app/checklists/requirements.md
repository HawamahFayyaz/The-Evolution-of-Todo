# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Console App (Phase I)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Technology stack section is included but clearly marked as constitutional constraints for reference only. Core requirements remain technology-agnostic.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 14 functional requirements are testable. Success criteria include specific time and completion metrics. Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 6 user stories with 15 acceptance scenarios cover all CRUD operations plus help. Each story includes priority, independent testing description, and acceptance scenarios.
