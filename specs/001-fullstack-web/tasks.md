# Tasks: Phase II Full-Stack Web Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-fullstack-web/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/ (complete)

**Tests**: Tests are included per constitution requirement for 80%+ test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/` (FastAPI, Python)
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` (Next.js, TypeScript)
- **Monorepo Structure**: Per Constitution Principle X

### User Story Dependencies

| User Story | Depends On | Can Start After |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| US1 (P1) | Phase 2 | Foundation complete |
| US2 (P2) | US1 | Auth endpoints working |
| US3 (P3) | US2 | CRUD operations working |
| US4 (P4) | US2 | Multiple users can create tasks |

### Within Each User Story

1. Backend implementation first (API endpoints)
2. Backend tests verify API behavior
3. Frontend API client integration
4. Frontend UI components and pages
5. End-to-end verification

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - All parallel:**
- T002-T013 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 - Grouped:**
- Backend tasks T014-T021 sequential
- Frontend tasks T022-T028 parallel (different files)
- Test infra T029-T031 parallel

**Phase 3 (US1):**
- Backend tests T036-T039 parallel
- Frontend auth pages can be parallelized

**Phase 4 (US2):**
- Backend tests T063-T071 parallel
- Frontend components T075-T080 parallel

**Phase 6 (US4):**
- All isolation tests T098-T102 parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Components

```bash
# Launch all backend API tests together:
Task: "Test GET /api/tasks returns user's tasks only"
Task: "Test GET /api/tasks returns empty array for new user"
Task: "Test POST /api/tasks creates task with user_id from JWT"
Task: "Test POST /api/tasks ignores user_id in request body"
Task: "Test DELETE /api/tasks/{id} sets deleted_at"

# Launch all frontend components together:
Task: "Create TaskCard component in frontend/components/task-card.tsx"
Task: "Create TaskForm component in frontend/components/task-form.tsx"
Task: "Create TaskList component in frontend/components/task-list.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Can users sign up, login, logout?
5. Deploy MVP if auth is working

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundation → Servers running
2. **Add US1** → Auth works → **Demo: "Users can sign up!"**
3. **Add US2** → CRUD works → **Demo: "Full task management!"**
4. **Add US3** → Persistence → **Demo: "Data never lost!"**
5. **Add US4** → Isolation → **Demo: "Secure multi-user!"**
6. Polish → Production ready

### Time-Boxed MVP

If time is limited:
1. Complete Phases 1-4 (US1 + US2 only)
2. Skip US3/US4 tests (persistence/isolation work by design)
3. Demo: Full authentication + task CRUD = working application

## Task Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Parallel |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1: Setup | 13 | 11 |
| Phase 2: Foundation | 18 | 8 |
| Phase 3: US1 Auth | 21 | 4 |
| Phase 4: US2 CRUD | 38 | 15 |
| Phase 5: US3 Persist | 7 | 3 |
| Phase 6: US4 Isolation | 10 | 6 |
| Phase 7: Polish | 10 | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | **117** | **52 (44%)** |

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Backend-first for each feature ensures API is ready when frontend needs it
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Constitution requires: soft deletes, user_id from JWT only, 80%+ test coverage
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
